        <h1>Deadeye</h1>
        <h3>Goes down smooth and hits like a flashbang.</h3>

        <p>While a steaming pot of black piñon coffee will get the gears going on an early-morning mission, 
            sometimes Cassidy Cole prefers a drink with a little more bite. <br>
            Made at the notorious Calaveras bar, featuring black tea and bourbon.</p>
