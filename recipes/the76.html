        <h1>The 76</h1>
        <h3>Nothing says summertime like a good ol' ice-cold milkshake!</h3>

        <p>Summer evenings were hot in Bloomington, Indiana, where Jack grew up.<br> 
            But after a long day of working on the farm, he was free to go spend time with friends<br> 
            at the local ice cream shop, where this milkshake was a specialty.</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1½ cups heavy cream, divided</li>
            <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
            <li>Red, white and blue sprinkles</li>
            <li>Red food coloring</li>
            <li>Blue food coloring</li>
            <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
            <li>8 scoops of vanilla ice cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by combining ½ cup of the heavy cream and all the white chocolate in a small bowl.<br>
                Microwave in 20-second bursts, being sure to stir in between each burst, until the chocolate is melted.</li>

            <li>Dip the rims of two tall serving glasses in the white chocolate, let any excess drip off, and then roll in the red, white, and blue sprinkles to make a festive rim.</li>

            <li>Mix the red food coloring with the remaining chocolate until you have a nice bright color.<br>
            Using a spoon or a piping bag, drizzle stripes of red down the inside of the glass. Set aside or in the freezer to chill.</li>

            <li>Make the whipped cream by beating the remaining 1 cup of heavy cream with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form, which should only take a minute or two.<br>
            Beat in the blue food coloring, and then set the whipped cream aside.</li>

            <li>Combine the milk, ice cream, and vanilla extract in a blender and blend until smooth.<br>
            Pour the milkshake into the prepared glasses, top with blue whipped cream, and serve with straws.</li>
        </ol>
